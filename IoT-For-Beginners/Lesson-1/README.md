<p>In IOT both software and hardware are equally important. In first week of our IOT journey we are going to learn about basic circuit building and few key components required in circuit designing.  
for connecting different components we generally use wires, but as complexity of project increases the circuit wires become messy and we cannot keep track of them. therefore we use some kind of board to make connections neater.  </p>

## Boards
<p>we can use three types of boards for connections on basis of refinement we need in our project :</p>

1. [BreadBoard](https://github.com/IoT-Buzz/IoT/tree/main/IoT-For-Beginners/Lesson-1/breadboard)
2. [PerfBoard](https://github.com/IoT-Buzz/IoT/tree/main/IoT-For-Beginners/Lesson-1/Perf_Board)
3. [Printed Circuit Board](https://github.com/IoT-Buzz/IoT/tree/main/IoT-For-Beginners/Lesson-1/PCB)


## Connections
<p> For connections it become very easy if we use jumper wires with breadboard. Jumper wires are of three types i.e. having male ends on both sides or female ends on both sides or one male and one female on either side. these cables are very easy to use and can be pluged directly into breadboard and other development boards like arduino , nodemcu ,etc .</p>

<p> For perfboard we usually do soldering over the board or soldering some wires over holes for connections this type of connections are little harder then direct plug in jumper connections but are more durable then them.</p>  

Follow [this](https://github.com/IoT-Buzz/IoT/tree/main/WEEK_of_learning/Week-1/soldering) for knowing more about soldering

<p> While in the case of pcb the connections are already made and we have to just solder the components in the circuit board for final product.</p>


## Components 
<p> there are many small electronic components required to make a working circuit like resistors , capaciators , ic, diodes, transistors,led's, capaciators, transformers, etc. But for time being let us learn a little about basic one's</p>

### Resistors
Resistors are two terminal electronic components used to limit the current flowing in a circuit.

you can follow this [link](https://byjus.com/physics/resistor/) for learning more about resistors.

### L.E.D
led stands for light emitting diode and as it's name suggest it emits light.It comes in variety of size and color.Led are just PN junction so they don't glow in reverse biased. We need to connect a pullup resistor with led so that they do not blow up by exessive current passing through them.

Led has two legs bigger one is for positive and the other is for negative.

### Transistor
A Transistor is a three terminal semiconductor device that regulates current or voltage flow and acts as a switch or gate for signals.
